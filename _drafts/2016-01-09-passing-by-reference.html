title: Passing by reference versus passing by value

<div class="post content">
  <p>Did you know that in JavaScript, certain values are passed by reference but others are passed by their values?
  There are two kinds of types: <span class="italic">primitive</span> types and <span class="italic">reference</span> types. Guess which ones are passed by reference?
  </p>

  <p>
  Primitive types are:
    <ul>
      <li>Booleans</li>
      <li>Strings</li>
      <li>Numbers</li>
      <li>Null</li>
      <li>Undefined</li>
    </ul>

  Reference types are:
    <ul>
      <li>Arrays</li>
      <li>Objects</li>
      <li>Anything that's not a primitive type</li>
    </ul>
  </p>

  <p>Primitive types are passed by value. Here's an example:
    <img class="full-column" src="/assets/images/reference/primitive.png">
    <img class="full-column" src="/assets/images/reference/reference.png">
  </p>
