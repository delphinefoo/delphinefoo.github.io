  <p>Part of student work at Hack Reactor is learning how to present effectively. To that end,
  one of our assignments in the first 6 weeks of the course (what's called the 'Junior' phase),
  was to prepare and present a 5-minute presentation on the topic of your choice, preferably tech-related.
  I chose to present about Big Data.</p>

  <p>I'm interested in Big Data because it's been a trendy term for quite a while, and I know that used properly, it can help organizations glean insights and make well-informed decisions; but I still had a lot of questions about certain details, such as how much data is actually considered 'Big', and how do you process and analyze it? Are you curious, too? Then read on...</p>

  <h1 class="centered">BIG DATA VS. DATA</h1><br>

  <p>There’s no specific threshold for how much data is considered big data; the term basically encompasses any data sets so large that you need multiple physical and/or virtual machines to process the data quick enough to be useful. Given the capabilities of hardware today, this means petabytes (1,024 terabytes) or exabytes (1,024 petabytes).</p>

  <h1 class="centered">BIG DATA IS OFTEN UNSTRUCTURED</h1><br>

  <p>Big data is often generated with no predefined model and not organized in a predetermined way. For example, website visitor logs (unstructured) vs. customer purchase data from the same website (structured).</p>

  <h1 class="centered">WHY THE RISE OF BIG DATA IN THE LAST DECADE?</h1><br>

  <p>The graph above shows a Google Trends search for the term "big data". You can see the trend really starts to take off around 2012. There are three main factors contributing to the rise of big data: hardware getting cheaper, and the emergence of cloud computing (both of which have made it possible for organizations with small budgets to store and make use of their big data), as well as the rise of the internet of things, which is producing massive amounts of data needing to be analyzed.</p>

  <h1 class="centered">PROCESSING AND ANALYZING BIG DATA</h1><br>

  <p>The most commonly used programming models for processing and analyzing big data are called Massively Parallel Processing (MPP) and MapReduce. Both of these allow processing of  data across multiple computers (a cluster), breaking large volumes of data down into smaller batches, and processing them separately, then merging them to generate the final results.</p>

  <p><a href="https://hadoop.apache.org/" target="_blank">Hadoop</a> uses MapReduce. Hadoop one of the most widely-used big data processing frameworks, and it’s open source. In contrast, the Massively Parallel Processing model was adopted by many for-profit companies to develop proprietary data warehousing and processing services.</p>

  <p>A few other differences between the two: MPP can’t handle unprocessed unstructured data, MapReduce can. MPP uses the SQL language, MapReduce uses Java as its interface language (however, there are libraries that can be used  with Hadoop that allow you to work with SQL-like languages).</p>

  <p>The MapReduce programming paradigm was developed by Google. However, in 2014 Google announced it was moving over to its new model called Cloud Dataflow, which sorts and analyzes at once, and is offering that as a paid service as well. Several other streaming analytic tools are also being offered by other companies, such as Amazon Kinesis, and Apache Spark. With the rise in demand of real-time data analysis, the use of streaming analytics and number of offerings of these kinds of tools is going to grow.</p>

  <h1 class="centered">ONE INTERESTING BIG DATA ANECDOTE</h1><br>

  <p>One interesting story about the successful use of big data is the way that the Obama campaign leveraged a team of over 100 data scientists to win his re-election in 2012.
  There are a lot of interesting things they did with data, but one quick example is that instead of relying on outside media consultants to decide where ads should run, the campaign used massive internal data sets to figure out where to place their ads. The team analyzed their target demographics and what tv shows they watched, then they used this data to choose how to most effectively spend their ad money. As a result, they placed ads during unconventional programming such as The Walking Dead and Sons of Anarchy. Traditionally, political campaigns place most of their ads around news shows. The team calculated that they were 14% more efficient at targeting prospective voters than they were in 2008.<sup><a href="#fn1-1" id="ref1-1">1</a></sup></p>

  <h1 class="centered">BIG POTENTIAL</h1><br>

  <p>Data volumes are exploding: more data has been created in the past two years than in the entire previous history of mankind.<sup>2</sup> At the moment less than 0.5% of all data is ever analyzed and used.<sup>3</sup>
  We've entered a stage of big data where collecting, processing and analyzing tools have become pretty mature, so what's next? Machine learning! Machine learning will allow us to take advantage of the emergence of streaming flows of massive data, and help us make smart predictions based on its algorithms. It's an exciting time for big data!</p>
