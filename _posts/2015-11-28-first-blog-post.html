  <p>This is my first foray into blogging with static website generator <a href="http://jekyllbootstrap.com/lessons/jekyll-introduction.html" target="_blank">Jekyll</a>.</p>
  <p>What is Jekyll? It's an open source parsing engine that helps you easily build websites using templates. No, Jekyll doesn't build the templates; you have to do that yourself. This ain't Wordpress, buddy. You can also include 'partials': elements that you design, like headers, footers, or sidebars, that you can reuse in any of your pages.</p>

  <p>The magic of mixing and matching using templates and partials is created through Jekyll's use of the <a href="http://www.liquidmarkup.org" target="_blank">Liquid</a>, a Ruby templating language.</p>

  <p>Jekyll is particularly useful for text-heavy blogs (like mine will be -- spoiler alert!), since it has the ability to parse files that are named using a particular naming convention, and create new pages on your site directly from those files. What's more, if you don't enjoy writing html, you can write your blog posts in <a href="https://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/" target="_blank">markdown</a>, and Jekyll will still parse them for you. Genius!</p>

  <p>If, like me, you're fairly new to programming, all of the above descriptions might sound like a lot of unintelligible jargon. If that's your take on it, a good way to see how Jekyll works might be to poke around some of the <a href="http://jekyllrb.com/docs/sites/" target="_blank">example sites</a> that currently use Jekyll, as well as their source code, and learn how the files relate to each other. Also, there's a great <a href="http://www.smashingmagazine.com/2014/08/build-blog-jekyll-github-pages/" target="_blank">article</a> in Smashing Magazine about the why and how-to-start of Jekyll. And, of course, read the <a href="http://www.jekyllrb.com" target="_blank">Jekyll docs</a>.</p>

  <p class="centered">Happy blogging!</p>
