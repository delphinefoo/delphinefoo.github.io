<div class="post content">
  <p>Did you know that in JavaScript, certain values are passed by reference but others are passed by their values?
  There are two kinds of types: <span class="italic">primitive</span> types and <span class="italic">reference</span> types. Guess which ones are passed by reference?
  <br>
  <br>
  Primitive types are:
    <ol class="ordered-list">
      <li>Booleans</li>
      <li>Strings</li>
      <li>Numbers</li>
      <li>Null</li>
      <li>Undefined</li>
    </ol>

  Reference types are:
  <br>
  <br>
    <ol class="ordered-list">
      <li>Arrays</li>
      <li>Objects</li>
      <li>Anything that's not a primitive type</li>
    </ol>
  </p>
  <p>Primitive types are passed by value. Here's an example:</p>
    <img class="full-column" src="/assets/images/reference/prim-ex1.jpg"><br>
  <p>In this example, when x changes from red to blue, y does not change. That's because when y was made equal to x, y was given the exact same value as x, but they were not pointing at the same place in memory. You can visualize it like this: </p>
    <img class="full-column" src="/assets/images/reference/prim-diag.jpg">
  </p>

  <p>Now let's look at a second example, using an object, which is a reference type (not a primitive type):</p>
  <img class="full-column" src="/assets/images/reference/ref-ex1.jpg"><br>
  <p>This weirdness happens because objects are passed <span class="italic">by reference</span>, not by value. This means that when we made y equal to x, we made y point to the same place in memory that x was pointing to, and they are pointing to the same object.</p>
  <img class="full-column" src="/assets/images/reference/ref-diag.jpg">
  <p>When you alter y, you are also altering x. This is important to remember when working with objects!</p>
