<div class="post content">
  <p>Did you know that in JavaScript, certain values are passed by reference but others are passed by their values?
  In JavaScript, there are two kinds of types when discussing data and values: <span class="italic">primitive</span> types and <span class="italic">reference</span> types. Guess which ones are passed by reference?
  <br>
  <br>
  Primitive types are:
    <ol class="ordered-list">
      <li>Booleans</li>
      <li>Strings</li>
      <li>Numbers</li>
      <li>Null</li>
      <li>Undefined</li>
    </ol>

  Reference types are:
  <br>
  <br>
    <ol class="ordered-list">
      <li>Arrays</li>
      <li>Objects</li>
      <li>Anything that's not a primitive type</li>
    </ol>
  </p>
  <p>Primitive types are passed by value. Here's an example:</p>
    <img class="full-column" src="/assets/images/reference/prim-ex1.jpg"><br>
  <p>In this example, when x changes from 5 to 7, y does not change. That's because when y was made equal to x, y was given the exact same value as x, but they were not pointing at the same place in memory. You can visualize it like this: </p>
    <img class="full-column" src="/assets/images/reference/prim-diag.jpg">
  </p>

  <p>Now let's look at a second example, using an object, which is a reference type (not a primitive type):</p>
  <img class="full-column" src="/assets/images/reference/ref-ex1.jpg"><br>
  <p>Here, when a property on the y object is changed, the same property on the x object is changed as well. This weirdness happens because objects are passed <span class="italic">by reference</span>, not by value. This means that when we made y equal to x, we made y point to the same place in memory that x was pointing to, and they are pointing to the same object.</p>
  <img class="full-column" src="/assets/images/reference/ref-diag.jpg">
  <p>When you alter y, you are also altering x. This is important to remember when working with objects!</p>
